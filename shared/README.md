WS253_ce10 -- WormBase WS253 gene annotations, lifted to the ce10 version of the genome using an in-house tool.

WS253_ce10.transcripts_protein_coding.gtf all protein-coding transcripts; used for getting gene-specific read counts

WS253_ce10.genes_by_CV.gtf genes coloured by CV values; useful for browsing

WS253_ce10.rRNA.bed has strict rRNA transcript starts/ends

WS253_ce10.rRNA_broad.bed includes surrounding regions defined manually by looking at transcription elongation data
